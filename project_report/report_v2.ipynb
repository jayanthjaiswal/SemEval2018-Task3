    "The advent of social media like Twitter and Facebook has led to rise of people using more creative and figurative language use like Irony, Sarcasm, Hyperbole etc to catch the social network‚Äôs attention for more likes and retweets. Natural Language Processing Tasks on such social media datasets like Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining, Argument Analysis etc struggle to maintain high performance, when applied to Ironic texts. We try to tackle this hard problem of Irony Detection using new advances in Deep Learning technologies. We approach the first tasks in our work based on SemEval 2018 dataset. The first task is to detect if a tweet is ‚Äúironic‚Äù or not (binary classification of 0 or 1)."

In addition to the deep learning model, we explored a boosting implementation. The idea was to use the same word embedding features that were used in the DNN in the boosting algorithm to see if we could achieve a better performance. A variety of feature implementations were tested. The features included sentiment score extractions, word embeddings, and a combination of the two."

    "It was hypothesized that ironic tweets would have words with starkly contrasting sentiment scores. Given a corpus, each tweet was tokenized. Each word in the tokenized list was passed through a sentiment analysis tool (nltk sentiwordnet) and the positive and negative scores of the word was kept track of. Looking at groups of 3 words at a time, the maximum positive sentiment score and the maximum negative sentiment score in the 3 word window was determined and the two values were subtracted to represent how \"far away\" the sentiments of these words were from each other. The number of 3-word chunks that were observed was a hyperparameter MAX_LEN_2 (shown in the code below) that was tuned.\n",

    "Since simply using sentiment scores did not perform very well, exploring word embedding features was the next approach. We utilized the pre-trained word embeddings called GloVe from Stanford and outputted two sets of features. For the first set, each tweet corresponded to a text file where each row represented a word in the tweet using a 25d word embedding. For the second set, each tweet corresponded to a text file where each row represented a word in the tweet using a 50d word embedding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first task was to preprocess the text files by flattening each text file into a 1 dimensinal array representing the word embedding for approximately the first 10 words in a tweet. The number of words that were included in the flattened word embedding vector was a hyperparameter, MAX_LEN (shown in the code below). Each tweet example was represented as a 1  x 250 dimensional vector. This way, the examples were stacked together to get a full input training data matrix (data_X in the code below) with dimensions 2834 X 251 (last column was the labels). \n",

Xgboost was run to fit a model to the training data. We used the XGBRegressor from the xgboost library. This was a classifier used a logistic regression model to perform the binary classification task. \n"

    "Even though we hypothesized that boosting would be a simple method to increase performance scores, it was observed that it was unable to beat the DNN approaches. The highest that was achieved using the boosting method was 62.50%, using 25d word embedding and sentiment score features. We concluded that in order to observe good performance for a boosting algorithm, proper feature selection is key. Feature selection in the task of classifying irony is complex and required more sophisticated systems such as DNNs, as opposed to the boosting approach.\n"
